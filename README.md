# 1. Keynote Speech
## Padmasree Warrior
* work across boundaries — work can be integrated with family (not mutually exclusive)

### Women Leaders

*Powerful Women Leaders*
1. Mary Dixon Kies
2. Ada Lovelace
3. Harriet Tracy

*Characteristics of a woman leader are changing with time*
Now: 
* influencer
* movement starter (/don’t be apologetic to be a feminist/)
* we don’t have to be different
* be yourself
* community builder
* share experiences

Before:
* isolated, very different from everyone else

*Eyes on the Stars, Feet on the Ground*

### What can we do?
* increase women engagement / highlight them
	* spotlight those doing cool stuff

### Stats
* in 2018 - women hold 24.04% of tech jobs
	* in 2017 - 22.99% (some improvement given # of tech jobs)

## Jessica Matthews
* young entrepreneur + black woman -> ceo/founder of uncharted power

### Her Story
* she is woman, black, and first-generation
	* didn’t match the status-quo
* dual-citizen
	* found infrastructure power is lacking — esp in Nigeria
	* *agency* to solve a problem can be helpful
		* empower locals to have agency to change problems
* she wasn’t trying to start a business -> she would have been too scared

### The problem
* working at refugee camps
	* girls CANNOT play soccer once they hit puberty
* *don’t silo* energy sources -> combine energy sources
* square peg in a circular hole

* her product -> 70% cheaper, 80% faster, 50% reduction in payback period — needed for developing areas

* a feminine perspective on tech
	* more collaboration
	* more sustainable
	* more communication
	* men have *ego*, want to do it all themselves
* being underestimated can be the best thing
	* no one will be intimidated by you and try to bring you down
	* more diverse

### What can we do and advice
* say “GROUNDBREAKING” about ourselves — women don’t do it as much as men
* don’t be afraid to THINK/WORK/LIVE our authentic truth
* *just because it’s not your plan doesn’t mean it’s not your destiny*
* *being that fresh face allows you to be GROUNDBREAKING*

# 2. Pivot or Die
## Panelists
1. Kaaren Hanson
	* director of product design at fb
	* *you don’t know your boundaries til you hit them*
	* a guy will say, “I nailed it”, but a woman won’t (even if she does just as well)
		* men assume experience is more positive for themselves than women even if same score
		* so — just tell yourself (if you’re a woman) — if you were a guy, you’d feel good about yourself
2. Sara Khoury
	* director of ux design at google
	* *comfort and growth don’t go together*
	* she started at startups
	* *follow intuition*
	* her path:
		* 1st pivot - family
			* make plan + budget
			* risk -> how to go back to work?
			* reward -> priceless
			* led to an identity shift
			* she wrote a letter to herself about why she was doing it and what she wanted to achieve after going back to work
		* 2nd pivot - get back into the workforce
			* research + design was internal at her company
			* found job @ job board — not through her network (which she los due to leaving work) — as senior vp
			* made name for herself as an exec
			* when she got comfortable and secure, opportunities show up 
			* *it’s a rocket ship — get on it*
			* panic — “what if we fail?”
				* coping mechanism:
					1. Go to calendar
					2. Find any day 3-6 weeks out
					3. Focus on getting to that date
					4. Repeat 
	* planning plays an important role, but *intuition* is needed to make decisions
		* develop intuition by going too far, making mistakes, and learning
		* so — listen to your gut
3. Margaret Schmidt
	* vp eng, intuit
	* none of her career was planned
	* pivots from moments when bored -> got too comfortable
	* find things that *give you energy* and chase those - even if hard
	* most meaningful pivot - at tiro after 16 years
		* take initiative to help when needed, even if out of the box
		* don’t stay within bounds of job description
			* volunteer the role if still doing day job 
		* make decision, then say ‘let me know if you want to over-rule me’ -> execs/bosses won’t have time to think of better option

## Q/A
### 1. Bigger is better (job titles)… is that true?
* impact is not determined by your title
* focus on growth and learning
* own your career
* “management track”??
	* *don’t do it!!* … now
		* if you have organizational skills, you’ll be pushed into management eventually
		* if you do it too early — you’ll become irrelevant
		* 10,000 hour rule -> 5-10 years
### partner’s careers … balancing pivots between two people? 
* note — it was interesting how much focus and thought was put into these women’s family and partners — this is probably not a question that a male software engineer/techie would ask or be concerned about. Food for thought :) 
* 2 people at startup with a fam is hard
	* take turns with risky job
* if bf doesn’t clean toilet, dump him now
	* need someone who’s truly a partner
### how to handle weaknesses?
* say yes to every opportunity related to weaknesses
* “in comfortable shoes, you forget you have feet” — *don’t get too comfortable* — /common theme/
* *keep getting up* - /common theme/ (it’s going to be hard, and you can only persevere — and find your ppl)
### do you have a backup plan?/
* have $$$
* with jobs — there will always be other jobs
* *when you know what you really want, the universe will conspire to make it happen*
### advice for new grads?
* people were told — ‘you’re here because you’re a gal’  or affirmative action
* *toughen up* - gain the scars
* say, *fuck you*
* keep pushing, and be ready
* help friends and other women
* *honing your craft - get VERY good* - /common theme/
	* become an expert
### when ready to pivot — walk away from company/reputation or stay internal? 
* walk away - learning app, reinvent self
* stay - can get sponsorships/move up faster
* *pick what gives you energy* - /common theme/ - don’t do just because it’s suggested or the norm
### these panelists are ‘Jill of all trades’ — is there still opportunities for new people?
* more specialization t large company — predictable, but can volunteer for new things outside of scope
* more creative freedom at startups, new types of roles, can build a spectrum of skills

## 3. Mind the Gap
*shoot for the moon… if you miss, you’ll land in the stars*
* a startup is 95% team and 5% idea
* why startups don’t fail
	* complimentary skillsets
	* support + respect each other’s roles
	* adaptability
* when evaluating a startup idea, look at:
	* market (is there need?)
	* competencies (can you build it?)
	* passion points
* launching v.s. not launching
	* better to launch early — discover more, less risk of ‘polishing a turd’ — you don’t know the users’ reception

## 4. Driving Social Impact
* panelists: 
	* Sandra liu huang
	* erin coffman
	* shripriya mahesh
	* era ozkan
	* Minnie ingersoll - code for America, google.org
### How to determine long-term impact?
* “what’s measured is treasured”
* believe people they work with make the right decisions — give agency to the local people - /common theme/
* ensure what you’re building is sustainable, and has ownership+involvement of locals
* if more stable in the short-term, helps in the long-term
* empower beneficiaries
	* i.e. help with the design
		* ownership ==> relevancy
* focus on the right outcomes
	* learning -> earning
* ask - *why do these problems exist?* - don’t just solve symptoms
* tech alone won’t solve the problem, in fact is far from it
	* need process and programming
* think, can there be a new system??
### How to stay oriented on a practical level?
* how to motivate team when project is very long-term? 
* what can we do now that’ll be most leveraged? 
	* i.e. in biotech ->  how to accelerate basic science today? 
		* more collaboration between labs (*no silos!!*)
	* set half goals every 6 months
* *no war is won according to plan, but no war is won without a plan*
* we need to build *with urgency* but coordinate for *sustainability*
* think about the user journey 
	1. Iterate with end-user
	2. Release minimal viable product often
	3. Repeat
* barriers:
	* cultural barrier
	* cost
	* language
* knowledge transfer is important to make sustainable
* “what’s the ideal journey?”
	* for each type elf user/participant
	* something working itself is not ideal
* understand the user - /common theme/
	* go out to where the tech will be used
	* immerse self in experience and get context *on the ground*
	* 100+ users
### is it possible to take that time? i.e. is it ok to think, ‘we can’t predict, so we’ll build first’? 
* sometimes there are creative approaches to fill roles you’re not trained in
* ‘you need to move slow to move fast’ -> make sure you don’t build too fast without direction
* have a diverse team — very critical to represent many perspectives
	* not productive initially, but good long-term
* *collective impact* - no single sector or solution will fix the problem
	* need to bring diverse group of stakeholders
	* work together to transfer knowledge
	* ^^ this applies to biotech/medicine too!
* like scaling production -> research has to be scaled too
* take a step back -> what’s the root of the problem we’re trying to solve?
	* don’t solve symptoms of the problem only
* have metrics to measure how you’re doing
### ‘how do I have meaningful impact?’ - non-profits v.s. for-profits
