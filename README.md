# Grace Hopper Notes
Notes from Grace Hopper Conference 2018. Please forgive typos!

# 1. Keynote Speech
## Padmasree Warrior
* work across boundaries — work can be integrated with family (not mutually exclusive)

### Women Leaders

**Powerful Women Leaders**
1. Mary Dixon Kies
2. Ada Lovelace
3. Harriet Tracy

**Characteristics of a woman leader are changing with time**
Now: 
* influencer
* movement starter (_don’t be apologetic to be a feminist_)
* we don’t have to be different
* be yourself
* community builder
* share experiences

Before:
* isolated, very different from everyone else

**Eyes on the Stars, Feet on the Ground**

### What can we do?
* increase women engagement / highlight them
	* spotlight those doing cool stuff

### Stats
* in 2018 - women hold 24.04% of tech jobs
	* in 2017 - 22.99% (some improvement given # of tech jobs)

## Jessica Matthews
* young entrepreneur + black woman -> ceo/founder of uncharted power

### Her Story
* she is woman, black, and first-generation
	* didn’t match the status-quo
* dual-citizen
	* found infrastructure power is lacking — esp in Nigeria
	* **agency** to solve a problem can be helpful
		* empower locals to have agency to change problems
* she wasn’t trying to start a business -> she would have been too scared

### The problem
* working at refugee camps
	* girls CANNOT play soccer once they hit puberty
* **don’t silo** energy sources -> combine energy sources
* square peg in a circular hole

* her product -> 70% cheaper, 80% faster, 50% reduction in payback period — needed for developing areas

* a feminine perspective on tech
	* more collaboration
	* more sustainable
	* more communication
	* men have **ego**, want to do it all themselves
* being underestimated can be the best thing
	* no one will be intimidated by you and try to bring you down
	* more diverse

### What can we do and advice
* say “GROUNDBREAKING” about ourselves — women don’t do it as much as men
* don’t be afraid to THINK_WORK_LIVE our authentic truth
* **just because it’s not your plan doesn’t mean it’s not your destiny**
* **being that fresh face allows you to be GROUNDBREAKING**

# 2. Pivot or Die
## Panelists
1. Kaaren Hanson
	* director of product design at fb
	* **you don’t know your boundaries til you hit them**
	* a guy will say, “I nailed it”, but a woman won’t (even if she does just as well)
		* men assume experience is more positive for themselves than women even if same score
		* so — just tell yourself (if you’re a woman) — if you were a guy, you’d feel good about yourself
2. Sara Khoury
	* director of ux design at google
	* **comfort and growth don’t go together**
	* she started at startups
	* **follow intuition**
	* her path:
		* 1st pivot - family
			* make plan + budget
			* risk -> how to go back to work?
			* reward -> priceless
			* led to an identity shift
			* she wrote a letter to herself about why she was doing it and what she wanted to achieve after going back to work
		* 2nd pivot - get back into the workforce
			* research + design was internal at her company
			* found job @ job board — not through her network (which she los due to leaving work) — as senior vp
			* made name for herself as an exec
			* when she got comfortable and secure, opportunities show up 
			* **it’s a rocket ship — get on it**
			* panic — “what if we fail?”
				* coping mechanism:
					1. Go to calendar
					2. Find any day 3-6 weeks out
					3. Focus on getting to that date
					4. Repeat 
	* planning plays an important role, but **intuition** is needed to make decisions
		* develop intuition by going too far, making mistakes, and learning
		* so — listen to your gut
3. Margaret Schmidt
	* vp eng, intuit
	* none of her career was planned
	* pivots from moments when bored -> got too comfortable
	* find things that **give you energy** and chase those - even if hard
	* most meaningful pivot - at tiro after 16 years
		* take initiative to help when needed, even if out of the box
		* don’t stay within bounds of job description
			* volunteer the role if still doing day job 
		* make decision, then say ‘let me know if you want to over-rule me’ -> execs/bosses won’t have time to think of better option

## Q/A
### 1. Bigger is better (job titles)… is that true?
* impact is not determined by your title
* focus on growth and learning
* own your career
* “management track”??
	* **don’t do it!!** … now
		* if you have organizational skills, you’ll be pushed into management eventually
		* if you do it too early — you’ll become irrelevant
		* 10,000 hour rule -> 5-10 years
### partner’s careers … balancing pivots between two people? 
* note — it was interesting how much focus and thought was put into these women’s family and partners — this is probably not a question that a male software engineer/techie would ask or be concerned about. Food for thought :) 
* 2 people at startup with a fam is hard
	* take turns with risky job
* if bf doesn’t clean toilet, dump him now
	* need someone who’s truly a partner
### how to handle weaknesses?
* say yes to every opportunity related to weaknesses
* “in comfortable shoes, you forget you have feet” — **don’t get too comfortable** — _common theme_
* **keep getting up** - _common theme_ (it’s going to be hard, and you can only persevere — and find your ppl)
### do you have a backup plan?/
* have $$$
* with jobs — there will always be other jobs
* **when you know what you really want, the universe will conspire to make it happen**
### advice for new grads?
* people were told — ‘you’re here because you’re a gal’  or affirmative action
* **toughen up** - gain the scars
* say, **fuck you**
* keep pushing, and be ready
* help friends and other women
* **honing your craft - get VERY good** - _common theme_
	* become an expert
### when ready to pivot — walk away from company/reputation or stay internal? 
* walk away - learning app, reinvent self
* stay - can get sponsorships/move up faster
* **pick what gives you energy** - _common theme_ - don’t do just because it’s suggested or the norm
### these panelists are ‘Jill of all trades’ — is there still opportunities for new people?
* more specialization t large company — predictable, but can volunteer for new things outside of scope
* more creative freedom at startups, new types of roles, can build a spectrum of skills

# 3. Mind the Gap
**shoot for the moon… if you miss, you’ll land in the stars**
* a startup is 95% team and 5% idea
* why startups don’t fail
	* complimentary skillsets
	* support + respect each other’s roles
	* adaptability
* when evaluating a startup idea, look at:
	* market (is there need?)
	* competencies (can you build it?)
	* passion points
* launching v.s. not launching
	* better to launch early — discover more, less risk of ‘polishing a turd’ — you don’t know the users’ reception

# 4. Driving Social Impact
* panelists: 
	* Sandra liu huang
	* erin coffman
	* shripriya mahesh
	* era ozkan
	* Minnie ingersoll - code for America, google.org
### How to determine long-term impact?
* “what’s measured is treasured”
* believe people they work with make the right decisions — give agency to the local people - _common theme_
* ensure what you’re building is sustainable, and has ownership+involvement of locals
* if more stable in the short-term, helps in the long-term
* empower beneficiaries
	* i.e. help with the design
		* ownership ==> relevancy
* focus on the right outcomes
	* learning -> earning
* ask - **why do these problems exist?** - don’t just solve symptoms
* tech alone won’t solve the problem, in fact is far from it
	* need process and programming
* think, can there be a new system??
### How to stay oriented on a practical level?
* how to motivate team when project is very long-term? 
* what can we do now that’ll be most leveraged? 
	* i.e. in biotech ->  how to accelerate basic science today? 
		* more collaboration between labs (**no silos!!**)
	* set half goals every 6 months
* **no war is won according to plan, but no war is won without a plan**
* we need to build **with urgency** but coordinate for **sustainability**
* think about the user journey 
	1. Iterate with end-user
	2. Release minimal viable product often
	3. Repeat
* barriers:
	* cultural barrier
	* cost
	* language
* knowledge transfer is important to make sustainable
* “what’s the ideal journey?”
	* for each type elf user/participant
	* something working itself is not ideal
* understand the user - _common theme_
	* go out to where the tech will be used
	* immerse self in experience and get context **on the ground**
	* 100+ users
### is it possible to take that time? i.e. is it ok to think, ‘we can’t predict, so we’ll build first’? 
* sometimes there are creative approaches to fill roles you’re not trained in
* ‘you need to move slow to move fast’ -> make sure you don’t build too fast without direction
* have a diverse team — very critical to represent many perspectives
	* not productive initially, but good long-term
* **collective impact** - no single sector or solution will fix the problem
	* need to bring diverse group of stakeholders
	* work together to transfer knowledge
	* ^^ this applies to biotech/medicine too!
* like scaling production -> research has to be scaled too
* take a step back -> what’s the root of the problem we’re trying to solve?
	* don’t solve symptoms of the problem only
* have metrics to measure how you’re doing
### ‘how do I have meaningful impact?’ - non-profits v.s. for-profits
* social impact and business aren’t separate things
* have to be a profitable business to be sustainable
* in your career:
	1. Choose company with a mission
	2. Ask questions - to all teams
		1. Who are we serving?
		2. What’s the user problem?
		3. How do we know we’re solving it?
	3. Demand accountability
* impact can be driven from any vantage point
* regardless of where you are, you can **drive impact**
	* individual level:
		* remote mentoring to ppl abroad
		* code sign product for different populations
		* fly into areas and help setup projects — wifi connectivity
* we need all these sectors to solve these problems
* **be excellent at the thing you want to do** - biggest chance to have impact
* be thoughtful about your impact
* there is a huge opportunity to apply tech innovation to problems otherwise not focused on
## notes from q/a
* language barrier is an important consideration (tech is useless if can’t be adopted by different communities)
* integration is **v** important so it helps entire society and is sustainable
* **software eng feels too far removed from the problem — how to still feel impactful?**
	* highlight wins + stories of users
	* hear stories of users + keep close to that
	* go out of your way
	* systemic approach - ask management how does this fit in?
* **how to be humble and not burden communities?**
	* build relationships
	* figure out **when, who** to meet
		* be respectful of their time
	* ask for feedback!
 
# Can hiring be need blind?
## Different companies represented:
1. [Greenhouse Inclusion](http://www.greenhouse.io/inclusion)
	* prevents unconscious bias
	* has resume highlights - hides name, college, names
	* anonymized take-home exercises
2. Cockroach Labs
3. [Blendoor](http://blendoor.com/)
	1. Founder [story](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephanienlampkin) is quite interesting
		1. Went to Stanford + MIT
		2. When she applied to Google — they said she ‘wasn’t technical enough’ and suggested she go into Sales/Marketing
	2. People say it’s a ‘pipeline problem’ 
4. Interviewing.io 
	1. Tech screen **first**
	2. No resumes, just technical interview before further interviews
	3. **branch.interviewing.io** - for good
		1. For underrepresented communities
	4. Stat -> 40% of people who got thru on interviewing.io are from non-traditional backgrounds (we see that at Freenome too)

* what is bias? 
	* example -> changing name Emily to Greg leads to 2x response
	* factors: name, age, gender, race
	* even women have this bias! Especially against Female POC
* better approach:
	1. Merit-based (interviewing.io)
	2. Anonymized Resumes (Greenhouse Inclusion)
	3. Either way -> collect metrics and **data** on how your’re doing
	4. Ask for candidate feedback
	
### practically, how long does it take to implement identity_blind process?
* has to be bought in by exec team
* huge **time** investment

* a process change is needed — people look for low-hanging fruit -> bad
* to drive change, there has to be a tectonic shift in how hiring is done
* someone may not look a certain way on paper
* school name is **not an indicator of performance** 
	* except for some demographics (black people, etc)
		* it helps them prevent bad unconscious bias
			* i.e. founder of Blendoor may not be seen as ‘credible’ without her Stanford degree - which is unfortunate bc that shouldn’t matter
* **call people out!!**
	* i.e. referring only people who look like and are like yourself — propagates more of this lack of diversity

# 5. Developing Your Personal Brand
Brand = what people say about you
* people challenge you — tell you what you can or cannot do -> challenge them! 
* market your skills that speak the same language to different people
	* learn how to pitch yourself
* take initiative to become the **‘go-to’ person** 
	* declare yourself as a leader
* be **intentional** about building a brand + skills
* startups have worse sexism than a big company
* ‘if you can’t beat them, beat them anyway’
## how to start a brand? 
* no one knows what they want to do
* think about what you aspire to be -> in terms of adjectives
* people don’t strive big enough
* look at job descriptions and circle what you want to be
* oppose **well-intended, terrible advice**
	* i.e. get an MBA to look like every other applicant (why would you want to blend in?)
* **take a NICHE problem and make it yours!!** - _common theme_
* never apply for a job again
* it’s okay not to know

## how to figure out transition
* ask questions that show what you like
* so people talk about you when you’re not there —> you’re a developer + _____something!_______ 
* build network and get introductions
* become an expert so you can talk about an issue
* women are bad abs talking about accomplishments
	* why?
		* imposter syndrome
		* modesty horn -> feel _physically_ uncomfortable
		* rescue fantasy -> raised to believe, if I work hard, someone will rescue me (that’s **bs**)
* stop downplaying yourself
	* if you know your strong areas, put yourself into a situation with strong feedback lab
		* i.e. control engineering your life

* when going to investors -> if you have a company, but it doesn’t do much yet
	* tell them, **believe in me as a person** - build a myth about yourself so investor believes in _you_
	
* being brutally honest is good - radical candor
* **first they ignore you**
	* **then they laugh at you**
	* **then they fight you you**
	* **then they join you**

* if you’re really an entrepreneur:
	* lots of NO
	* it’s so hard
	* have to be a bit crazy - listen to your craziness
* even if lots of push back, keep talking, and then people will eventually respond
	* then find the person who gets so excited - then u golden

# 6. Breaking up the Boys’ Club
Read [this](https://www.amazon.com/Brotopia-Breaking-Boys-Silicon-Valley/dp/0735213534)!

* in the 40s/50s - women were well represented in software (and men in hardware)
* [‘The Computer Girls’](https://boingboing.net/2015/07/31/the-computer-girls-1967-c.html) - Cosmo 1967
* What happened?
	* in 60s/70s -> desperate for talent, tech companies (?) used personality tests
		* ‘good programmers like solving puzzles’
		* ‘good programmers don’t like people’
			* so, more men
				* **but**, there’s no evidence that people who don’t like people are good at the job
				* in fact, it makes more sense the other way around - building for the user
	* so, they pushed women out
	* women with a CS degree dropped from 37% to 18%
* movies didn’t create stereotypes, **the tech industry created and REINFORCED the pipeline problem** -> dominated by **white men**
* if you don’t look the part, people will naturally ask tougher questions
* even today (look @ facebook, PayPal)
	* call themselves a ‘_meritocracy_’, even though the founders admit that they hired their friends (i.e. look like them)
		* this myth is damaging
	* Silicon Valley is a modern _utopia_, where you can change the world .. if you’re a man
	* meritocracy is impossible, because everyone comes with different privilege
		* never an even playing field
	* ‘[meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_of_the_Meritocracy)’ was actually coined by a British sociologist do describe a **dystopian society** 

* **Silicon Valley embraces hard problems (sending people to space, self-driving cars, curing cancer)**, but when it comes to Diversity & Inclusion, they say **it’s too hard**

* so naturally, girls who code are scared
	* **you cannot be what you can’t see** - not enough role models
	* be something the next generation can see

* women are 2x more likely to quit tech
	* so.. 
		* help women thrive 
		* create your own path

* steps a company can take
	* (good intentions aren’t enough)
	* ex. Google
		* before -> Sergey and Larry explicitly cared about hiring women 
			* they **blocked hiring** until x women were hired 
		* after growth -> their other priorities took over, lost women representation
	* can’t stop after meeting some quota - continue year after year
	* unconscious bias training isn’t enough - need to **give tools** to conquer bias
	* example:
		* don’t start interviewing until 2 women, 2 POC
	* have **hindsight**
	* be explicit
	* if you say you care, it attracts more people

* take-aways
	* know your value
	* be true to yourself
	* companies _want_ to be on the right side of history
	* we’re up against a lot
	* embrace the fact that you’re a woman
	* find people who are championing this effort
	* diverse team = **no blind spots**
	* it’s not all on women - men should speak up too
	* **this game is rigged**


# The arc of history is long and random, but you have the opportunity to bend it.
